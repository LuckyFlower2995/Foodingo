You're preparing to cook a deep-fried eggplant as 
a side dish and garnish for the main course. You're friend 
offers to help.
As you prepare the eggplant, you watch your friend add oil to the pan
and turns up the heat.
Moments later it starts smoking.

What should you do FIRST to troubleshoot the problem?
-ask him what tyoe of oil he added to the pan
-check the heat setting on the stove
-check if there is any food in the pan
-inspect the stove to see if it has malfunctioned

10 minutes after putting a chicken in the oven you notice that the 
oven temperature is too low by 50 degrees Farenheit, you know
this temperature will not brown the chicken.

What should you do to successfully roast the chicken?
-set oven to correct temperature for roasting, keeping the chicken
inside the oven
-remove the chicken set the oven to slightly above the temperature
for roasting. Return the chicken to oven once the temperature
is reached.
-remove the chicken set the oven, set oven to right temperature
for roasting. Return the chicken to oven once the temperature
is reached.
-Turn off oven, keeping chicken inside the oven. Turn oven back on and
set it to the right temp for roasting

You are making mashed potatoes. You start by peeling them and putting them
into cold water to prevent them from turning brown. How should you cook the potatoes?
-put them into boiling water and continue boiling until cooked
-put them into simmering water and continue simmering until cooked
-put them into cold water and bring to a boil. Continue boiling
until they are cooked.

You have been asked to cook beef stew for dinner. You begin
by cutting the beef into even cubes. 

How should you stew the beef?
-Make sure the cooking liquid covers the meat when you begin cooking.
Add more liquid if needed.
-Make sure the cooking liquid covers onlyhalf of the meat when you 
begin cooking. Do not add more liquid during cooking.
-Make sure the cooking liquid covers the meat when you begin cooking,
do not add more liquid during cooking.
-Make sure the cooking liquid covers half of the meat when you begin cooking
and maintain it that way during cooking.

 
Convection is when heat passes from one object to another through direct contact.
True/False?

Convection is actually the transfer of heat through the movement of a fluid, 
such as air or water. It does not require direct contact between objects. 
This process occurs when warmer, less dense fluid rises and cooler, denser 
fluid sinks, creating a continuous circulation of heat. Therefore, the given
statement is false.

What is the reason that food is cooked?
-makes food easier to digest
-makes food taste better
-makes food safe for consumption
-All the above

Radiation that utilizes short, high-frequency waves that penetrate food, 
which agitates its water molecules to create friction and transfer heat. 
-microwave
-infrared
-nuclear
-exothermic

Microwave radiation is the correct answer because it utilizes short, 
high-frequency waves that can penetrate food. These waves agitate the 
water molecules present in the food, causing friction and generating heat. 
This heat transfer is what allows microwaves to cook or heat food quickly and 
efficiently. Infrared radiation is also used for cooking, but it does not 
penetrate as deeply as microwave radiation. Nuclear radiation and exothermic 
radiation are not commonly used for cooking or heating food.

This occurs when the proteins and sugars in the food are exposed to heat and 
merge together to form a brown exterior surface.
-Malard Reaction
-Maillard Reaction-Mayard Reaction
-Over Action

The correct answer is Maillard Reaction. This reaction occurs when the proteins 
and sugars in the food are exposed to heat and merge together to form a brown 
exterior surface. It is a chemical reaction that gives cooked food its 
distinctive flavor, color, and aroma. The Maillard Reaction is responsible 
for the browning of bread, searing of meat, and the caramelization of sugar.

The reaction that occurs when sugars are exposed to high heat and produce 
browning and change in flavor.
-Coloration
-Browning
-Caramelization
-None of the above

Caramelization is the correct answer because it refers to the reaction that 
occurs when sugars are exposed to high heat. This reaction leads to the 
browning of the sugars and a change in flavor, resulting in the formation of 
caramel. Coloration may be a general term that encompasses various reactions, 
but specifically, caramelization is the process that fits the given description.

Process of gently simmering the liquid until it reduces in volume and results 
in a thicker and more concentrated flavor.
-boiling
-simmering
-reduction
-evaporation

Reduction is the correct answer because it refers to the process of gently 
simmering a liquid until it reduces in volume, resulting in a thicker and more 
concentrated flavor. This technique is commonly used in cooking to enhance the 
taste and consistency of sauces, soups, and other dishes. During reduction, the 
liquid evaporates, intensifying the flavors and creating a more flavorful end 
product.

The process of protein changing from liquid to a semisolid or solid-state when heat or 
friction is applied.
-Coagulation
-Caramelization
-Melting
-simmering

Coagulation refers to the process of protein changing from liquid to a 
semisolid or solid-state when heat or friction is applied. This process 
occurs when proteins denature and form a network of bonds, resulting in the 
thickening or solidifying of a substance. Coagulation is commonly observed in 
the cooking of eggs or the formation of curds in cheese-making. This explanation
 aligns with the given definition of coagulation and accurately describes the 
 process.

 The meat of all the large domestic cattle, including heifer, cow, ox, bullock and bull.
 -beef
 -veal
 -ox
 -bull

 The correct answer is beef because beef refers to the meat of all large domestic cattle, 
 regardless of the specific gender or age of the animal. It includes the meat from heifers, 
 cows, oxen, bullocks, and bulls. Veal specifically refers to the meat from young calves, while 
 ox and bull refer to specific genders of cattle. Therefore, beef is the most appropriate term 
 to use in this context.

 The farther the meat from the head and the hoof, the more tougher the meat will be.
 -True/False?

 False. The statement is false because the toughness of meat is not determined 
 by its distance from the head and hoof. The tenderness of meat is influenced by factors such 
 as the cut of meat, the age of the animal, the marbling of fat, and the cooking method used. 
 So, the distance from the head and hoof does not directly affect the toughness of the meat.

 Beef dish cooked in red wine.
 -Osso Bucco
 -Bulalo
 -Beef Bourguignon
 -Veal Piccata

 Beef Bourguignon is a classic French dish made by slow-cooking beef in 
 red wine. The dish is known for its rich and flavorful sauce, which is 
 created by combining the wine with beef broth, onions, carrots, and herbs. 
 The slow cooking process allows the beef to become tender and infused with 
 the flavors of the wine and other ingredients. Beef Bourguignon is typically 
 served with potatoes or crusty bread, making it a hearty and satisfying meal.

 Good quality pork is identified by firm pink flesh, which shows no signs of 
 moisture, with a relatively big amount of fat over the outside and should have 
 a big amount of marbling.
 -True/False?

The statement is false because good quality pork is not identified by a 
relatively big amount of fat over the outside. Instead, good quality pork 
should have a moderate amount of fat, and the flesh should be firm, pink, 
and show no signs of moisture. Additionally, it should have a big amount of 
marbling, which refers to the small streaks of fat within the muscle fibers.
